**Setting up environment**\
This section loads multiple R packages that are essential for data processing, cleaning, and analysis.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#load packages
library(readr)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

**Import Data into R**\
This step imports multiple data sets using the `read_csv()` function from the `readr` package. Each data set contains specific health-related data collected from Fit-bit users.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Import Data
activity <- read_csv("Data/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
sleep <- read_csv("Data/sleepDay_merged.csv")
weight <- read_csv("Data/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
```

**Data Validation**\
This step ensures that the imported data-sets have the correct structure by checking their column names.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Data Validation
colnames(activity)
colnames(sleep)
colnames(weight)

```

**Preview the Data**\
This step displays the first few rows of each data-set to understand the structure and contents.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Preview Data
head(activity)
head(sleep)
head(weight)

```

**Data Type Conversion, Column Renaming**\
This step ensures consistency by converting ID columns to character type, formatting date columns, and renaming date-related columns for clarity.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Convert Id to character data type 
# Convert Day to date format 
# Rename various dates to Day
  
activity <-activity %>%
  mutate_at(vars(Id), as.character) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(ActivityDate), as.Date, format = "%m/%d/%y") %>%
  rename("Day"="ActivityDate")

sleep <-sleep %>%
  mutate_at(vars(Id), as.character) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(SleepDay), as.Date, format = "%m/%d/%y") %>%
  rename("Day"="SleepDay")

weight <-weight %>%
  mutate_at(vars(Id,LogId), as.character) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(Date),as.Date, format = "%m/%d/%y") %>%
  rename("Day"="Date")
```

**Merging Datasets and Adding Day of the Week**\
This step **combines all three datasets (`sleep`, `activity`, and `weight`)** into a single data-frame while ensuring that no data is lost. It also **adds a new column for the weekday name**, making it easier to analyze trends based on days of the week.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Combine data frames & add day of the week 

combined_data <-sleep %>%
  full_join(activity, by=c("Id","Day")) %>%
  full_join(weight, by=c("Id", "Day")) %>%
  mutate(Weekday = weekdays(as.Date(Day, "m/%d/%Y")))
```

**Removing Duplicates, Counting Missing Values, and Checking Unique Users**\
This step ensures data quality by removing duplicate rows, counting missing (NA) values, and checking the number of unique users in each data-set.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Find and remove duplicate rows & count 'NA' and distinct Ids

 combined_data <-combined_data[!duplicated(combined_data), ]
  sum(is.na(combined_data))
  n_distinct(combined_data$Id)
  n_distinct(sleep$Id)
  n_distinct(weight$Id)
```

**Ordering the Days of the Week**\
This step ensures that the `Weekday` column is correctly **ordered** in a logical sequence (Sunday → Saturday) rather than being treated as un-ordered text. This is important for **proper visualization and analysis**.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Order the days of the week
   
combined_data$Weekday <-factor(combined_data$Weekday, levels=c
                               ("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", 
	                               "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
```

**Generating Summary Statistics**\
This step provides **descriptive statistics** for key variables, helping to understand the overall distribution, central tendencies, and possible outliers in the dataset.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Select summary statistics 

combined_data %>%
   select(TotalMinutesAsleep, TotalSteps, TotalDistance, VeryActiveMinutes, 
          FairlyActiveMinutes, LightlyActiveMinutes, SedentaryMinutes, Calories, 
          WeightKg, Fat, BMI, IsManualReport) %>%
   summary()
 
```

**Saving the Cleaned Data**\
This step **saves the cleaned and processed dataset** as a CSV file, ensuring that the data is available for further analysis, visualization, or sharing.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#Save the cleaned data

write.csv(combined_data,file = "Data/combined_data.csv",row.names = FALSE)
```

This phase ensures that the dataset is accurate and optimized for the next step: **Analysis**. 🚀

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **7. [Phase 5: Act]{.underline}**

#### **Key Takeaways:**

-   **Correlation Between Steps and Calories Burned**: The data indicates a **positive relationship** between the number of steps taken and calories burned. However, some individuals achieve high calorie burn despite lower step counts, suggesting the impact of **exercise intensity, duration, and metabolic differences**.
-   **Impact of Activity Intensity**: The analysis highlights that individuals with more **Very Active Minutes** tend to burn more calories per minute. This suggests that **high-intensity activities (e.g., running, HIIT workouts) are more efficient at burning calories** than simply increasing step count.
-   **Variability in Individual Performance**: Despite the trend, **some individuals deviate from the expected pattern**, possibly due to factors like body composition, fitness level, or external influences (e.g., diet, lifestyle, metabolism). Understanding these variances can help in **customizing fitness plans** for better results.

#### **Recommendations:**

-   **Encourage High-Intensity Activities**: Since Very Active Minutes show the strongest correlation with calorie burn, users should be encouraged to **incorporate more vigorous workouts** rather than just increasing their step count. Activities like **cycling, swimming, weight training, or sprint intervals** can be beneficial.
-   **Personalized Goal-Setting**: Instead of setting a **universal step goal**, tailor goals based on **individual calorie burn efficiency** and preferred activity types. For example, someone who burns more calories through fewer steps might focus on **strength training and cardio bursts** rather than simply walking more.
-   **Improve Data Tracking & Insights**: Enhance tracking mechanisms to **capture more variables**, such as **heart rate, metabolic rate, and active vs. passive calories burned**, to get a **more accurate picture** of individual fitness trends. Advanced fitness trackers and smart analytics tools can be leveraged to provide **personalized recommendations**.
-   **Behavioral Motivation & Engagement**: Implement **gamification techniques**, such as challenges, leaderboards, and rewards, to keep users **engaged in their fitness journey**. Personalized reminders and feedback based on individual performance trends can help sustain motivation.

### **8. [Phase 6: Conclusion]{.underline}**

The analysis of activity levels, steps, and calories burned has provided valuable insights into the relationship between **movement intensity and energy expenditure**. The data confirms that while step count is an important metric, **the intensity of activity plays a more significant role in calorie burn**. Individuals who engage in higher-intensity workouts, reflected in their **Very Active Minutes**, tend to achieve greater calorie expenditure compared to those with similar step counts but lower intensity levels.

Additionally, the variations in individual performance suggest that **a one-size-fits-all approach to fitness tracking may not be ideal**. Factors such as **metabolic rate, workout type, and lifestyle differences** impact the effectiveness of physical activity, highlighting the need for **personalized fitness recommendations**.

Moving forward, the key takeaway is that simply focusing on increasing daily steps may not be the most effective strategy for optimizing calorie burn. Instead, a **more holistic approach that includes high-intensity activities, personalized fitness goals, and improved data tracking** will yield better long-term health outcomes.

By leveraging these insights, we can refine fitness strategies to **maximize efficiency, improve user engagement, and enhance overall well-being**.
